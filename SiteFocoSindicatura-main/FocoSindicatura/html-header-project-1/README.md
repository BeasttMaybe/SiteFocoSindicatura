# HTML Header Project

This project demonstrates a simple HTML structure with a header element that includes a title and navigation links.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

To view the HTML header, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser.
